# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview of Project

### Purpose

This SQL analysis and code is wrtten in order to deterrmine the number of retiring employees per title and further identify employees who meet the requirements to be a part of the mentorship program. This analysis will assist Bobby's manager in preparing for the "silver tsunami" as a number of current employees are nearing the retirement age. This is crucial as the manager will use our analysis and data to make decisions on the next-gen employees who will be recruited to further achieve success at the firm.

### Results

* The most important and first table created includes information on the retirement reaching employees. <img width="524" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-19 at 7 32 38 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93164021/146696651-fee50d8c-ac9c-46ed-86a9-befe55b6b431.png">
* Further, having noticed the duplicate entries, a process of removing the duplicates took place leading to a new table called unique_titles to have efficient data. <img width="396" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-19 at 7 35 28 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93164021/146696773-d990dac4-410b-4c88-9591-857ba9b2e400.png">
* To make the data more presentable, a table called retiring_titles was created giving the total number of employees under each title retiring. <img width="191" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-19 at 7 36 38 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93164021/146696824-c96e8341-dcfc-494d-8dab-a08564803ded.png">
* Lastly, to complete our analysis and data extraction, we created a table presenting those employees who are eligible for the mentorship program as seen. <img width="596" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-19 at 7 37 35 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93164021/146696854-802aeb88-cd9f-45ff-a59f-fd56aeaba548.png">

### Summary

* <img width="136" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-19 at 7 40 51 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93164021/146696995-09a5f26f-8807-40dc-9e21-494363504285.png"> Looking at this attached image, 72,458 roles will have to be filled as the 'silver tsunami' makes an impact, which will need the manager to make quick and important decisions to ensure the company does not lag behind due to a lack of human power.
* <img width="134" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-19 at 7 43 47 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93164021/146697107-1eaaf6a8-ed92-4bb7-ab79-20b8c425fecf.png"> Looking at this attached image, 397620284 employees are eligible for the mentorship program, however there are only 72,458 retirement-ready employees available, therefore it seems like there is a shortage in the qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
